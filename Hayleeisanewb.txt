There once was a lee that liked Hay. In her quest to obtain the most hay 
in the world she found that no one even cared about hay. The hay for which 
Lee cared so deep was truly a a cause for Lee to weep. The amount of tears
that flowed from Lee's eyes was the amount that could drown a flea.
The tears for the hay prompted the world to rename her Haylee.
End.
